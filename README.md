## Description

Backend for a e-commerce API! A small but relatively simple complete API using expresss with the ability to create, read, update and delete products, tags or categories; while saved on a local MySQL database which allows for data to be managed using sequelize in JavaScript.

This was made to explore how the backend of a web shop would function and work in conjuction with a database where data would be retrieved and sent. It also allowed me to gain an increase in confidence of using Sequelize as a way to interact with an SQL database.

I am now more comfortable using Sequelize to manage the CRUD process of an SQL server and avoid using raw SQL syntax.
